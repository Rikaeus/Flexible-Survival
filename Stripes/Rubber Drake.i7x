[ Adds a blank row to the table, this is immediately filled ;) ]
When Play begins:
	Choose a blank row from Table of random critters;
	now name entry is "Rubber Drake"; [The creature's name as displayed and used in naming descriptions]
	now attack entry is "ERROR: Rubber Drake - Not a creature."; [Text used when the monster succeeds on an attack]
	now defeated entry is "[beattherubberdrake]"; [ Text when monster loses. Change 'template' as above. ]
	now victory entry is "[losetorubberdrake]"; [ Text when monster wins. Change 'template' as above. ]
	now desc entry is "[rubberdrakedesc]"; [ Description of the creature when you encounter it. ]
	now face entry is "stretched out into a draconic muzzle with brow ridges and horns. It all feels kind of rubbery and all molded together, even the tiara you're wearing is part of it and appears as if shoddily painted golden yellow. It is more like some kind of [if mdasslevel > 0]Magic Drake [end if]mask you can't take off, though it certainly feels like its part of you when you touch it";
	now body entry is "excessively curved with outlandishly over-sized hips and buttocks on an otherwise average (if nine-foot tall) frame. This massive bottom has no real weight to it, feeling empty as if filled only with air, much like the rest of you. Your hands and feet have changed, now sporting rubbery talons like costume gloves. You have a pair of latex wings on your back that, despite being balloon-like, you're able to move around[if mdasslevel > 0]. Overall, you look and feel like a rubbery imitation of a certain drake you've met[end if]";
	now skin entry is "green rubber with a scale pattern printed across your";
	now tail entry is "You sport a puffy rubber tail loosely shaped like that of a dragon.";
	now cock entry is "[one of]green[or]rubber[or]draconic[at random]";
	now face change entry is "stretches and shifts and you begin to feel light-headed. Through momentarily blurred vision, you can see a rubbery, draconic muzzle start to form. Brow ridges and horns sprout up, but they're made of firm rubber and feel as if a molded part of your head. The whole of it seems to be molded together actually, with the seams a little uneven at times";
	now body change entry is "an unusual sensation spreads through you. Starting off as a tingle of strange energy, it builds until your body starts reshaping itself. Your figure changes, becoming nearly nine feet tall, with an exaggeratedly curvy shape. While your torso and arms are standard enough, your [if breast size of player > 5]breasts, [end if]ass and hips swell up, inflating to great size. They grow and grow until each buttock exceeds your own waist in size. Distracted by this change, you hardly notice at first your hands and feet gaining rubbery talons and textured scales. The growing pressure at your shoulder blades does get your attention though, building uncomfortably until finally pushing out a pair of latex dragon wings with inflated, balloon-like struts";
	now skin change entry is "green rubber spreads across your skin with a scaled pattern marked onto it";
	now ass change entry is "your rear puffs up, filling with air pressure. This grows and grows until that air is funnelled into a new, draconic tail made of rubber that swells from your spine";
	now cock change entry is "throbs and twitches. Precum drools from it and, as you watch with an odd excitement, it becomes green in colour with a rubbery feel";
	now str entry is 11; [ These are now the creature's stats... ]
