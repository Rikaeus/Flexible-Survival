Instead of resolving Shark Warrior:
	say "     As usual you walk parallel to the open sea. There is a soft breeze, keeping the sea in motion. It also brings the familiar, salty ocean smell to your nostrils. Enjoying the view, you take a moment to just stand there and let the silence soothe you. Unfortunately it doesn't last long; the silence is disturbed by a great splash in the water. A feral sea dragon surfaces with a loud and angry roar. Just a moment later you see that the dragon is flailing around, trying to hit something desperately. The struggling dragon sinks backside into the blue. You can briefly spot an ochre humanoid on the creature's belly, wrestling the angry monster. After a while a tiger shark surfaced from the water. His naked body is pretty built and shows some scars along his body, proof of his constant strife in this world. He's also adorned with a couple of trinkets; a necklace with teeth of some of the dragons he beat and there's also a rope tied around his hips. He turns towards you in the banks, mustering the witness of his battle.";

		say "     The shark stands on the shore for a bit, trying to assert your form. 'Well, look at that. You dragons don't seem to understand your place in this world. It's in the sea, with me!' With that the shark starts running towards you.";

			say " towards the sea. 'Go back your place, dragon! If you behave well, we can play around more there,' the warrior insisted.";
			say "     The shark doesn't even give you a second glance, as he spots the same feral sea dragon from before, moving towards another spot on the beach. He dives head first into the water, trying to make his way quickly. When he is somewhat far away you walk back in a not so conspicuous way.[if player is submissive] But some part of you secretly hopes that he does spot you moving away.[end if]";
		else:
			LineBreak;
			say "     The warrior slowly gets up again. 'You win for now, dragon. But I promise you, I'll get back at you for this!' With that he dives back into the sea.";
	else:	[Normal path. He is pumped about his victory but still jovial. He wants to share the moment with you. If you accept, you'll have sex with him]
		say "     He starts flexing his upper body grinning all the while at you with his menacing teeth. He certainly takes his time sweet time to make sure you can gaze upon his pectorals and arms. You can now see why a dragon would struggle with him. The shark struts towards you confidently, and again he took his time to give you more opportunities to gaze upon his slickened body. A pleasantly deep voice greets you. 'You seem like a swell guy. Keeping the area safe is a thankless job, as most of the others are more concerned with getting their rocks off. How about giving me a small reward? You can also consider it a reward in itself to get your hands on me!'";
		say "     [bold type]Do you want to reward the shark warrior?[roman type][line break]";
		LineBreak;
		if player consents:
			say "     The fish-guy lets out a vocal 'Yes!' With that he practically jumps you, pressing his hard body against yours. His large mouth is seeking yours, making you a little worried about the teeth that might be poking into you. Surprisingly enough his teeth aren't as far out as you expected, you even feel along with your tongue to convince yourself that they are truly there. During your make-out session, your layers of clothes are quickly being undone by the eager fish-man. 'Alright, pal. How about we skip to the good stuff? I've got some nice cocks that need some attention, too.' You sneak a peek towards his uncovered groin. He's sporting two pointed, glistening erections.";

			say "     Satisfied the tiger shark gives you one last playful swat to your butt as a goodbye. 'Thanks, pal. Stuff like this definitely keeps me going to make the beach safe of these dragons!' With that your partner takes off to the water, leaving you on your own in this wide beach again.";
		else:
			say "     The shark warrior lets out a shocked gasp. After a moment of getting back his composure, he tells you, 'Alright, bud. That means that I have to work harder to impress the likes of you! With that, the shark runs back towards the open ocean and dives right in. You should get going, as you're probably not going to get another moment of peace with this guy around.'";
