They sound pretty excited and/or aggressive, with further noises on top that seem to belong to a fight. You wonder what is going on, and if you should check it out. Could be difficult to actually find out where exactly they are - the sound could be bouncing off the surrounding buildings... so it is easy to accidentally get going in exactly the wrong direction.";

Seems like they ambushed the men by boxing their vehicle in with an abandoned car rolled out on the street behind them while the men were trying to clear some rubble at the front. Now the soldiers can't drive away and are stuck hiding out in the jeep from a near-constant aerial bombardment with trash and all kinds of stuff.

Seems like her fall was slowed by the car roof she landed on and dented in, and the nanites are now doing their usual quick work of quickly fixing anything that doesn't kill instantly. Seeing the trickle of milk running down the windscreen of the car the semiconscious gryphon lies on and starting at her generous bosom, you decide to be pragmatic and use the chance to milk her, filling up an empty plastic bottle from your pack before you move on.";

It was time you took some...";

The newly transformed herm under you squawks in surprise as you take his virginity, then quickly gets into getting fucked, rocking back to meet each of your thrusts. As you slam in and out of him, you both let out a keening noises of pleasure, increasing in volume until you both climax.";

Already subsumed by the infection, the former soldier does what any real gryphon herm would do - mount you and slam his still transforming cock into your waiting hole, pistoning in and out. Even though you've already come two times, feeling his manhood inside you quickly gets you going again, especially as you feel his knot form and get hard inside you. As you're quickly driven over the edge and a copious amount of femcum starts to drip onto the back seats of the jeep from your stretched pussy, the changed soldier leans in with a cry and climaxes into you.[ovichance]";

Some quick hand to clawed hand wrangling later, the humans - being the losers - are dragged out of the car, stripped and fucked.";
